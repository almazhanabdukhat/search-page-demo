## User Experience Design

This repository contains instructions and files for two assignments that together comprise the user experience design phase of a web app.

Replace the contents of this file with the completed assignments, as described in:

- [app map and wireframe instructions](./instructions-app-map-wireframe.md).
- [prototype instructions](./instructions-prototype.md)


### App map and wireframes for the Covid Travel Agent


Overwrite the contents of the `README.md` in your team's assignment repository with a new version that shows the app map and each of the wireframe diagrams.

- The diagrams must be displayed in a logical order and in a visual size that is easy to view when posted on GitHub.com.
- Make this document easy-to-read, with clear headings and sub-headings, and good formatting of text.
- For the wireframe diagrams, include the title of each diagram, as well as a simple explanation of the purpose of the screen it represents.
- Any functionality of the screen that is not obvious should be written into the document.
